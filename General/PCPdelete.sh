README Last Updated: 2/13/2011

Description
Individuals who perform integrations of Podcast Producer (PCP) or who are administrators of their PCP environments and begin testing workflows find themselves with a server that contains media files which are no longer suited for a production environment.  Integrators/SysAdmins also know that the current tools for removing Podcasts are limited to a minus button within Wiki/Blog (which does not remove the actual PNG/MOV files, nor removes them from the PCP Library).  In order to fully delete Podcasts, PCPdelete was created.

Solution
PCPdelete provides a Command line interface that allows you to delete from three different selections:

1) List Workflows
2) List Podcasts
3) List Wiki Posts

How To
1. Workflows
Function: This section will list all the available workflows within your PCP environment.  The script looks inside your {PCPLibrary}/Server/Workflows/ and finds all the "pwf" files, then print's their Names and UUIDs.  Copy/Paste the UUID and the script performs "podcast --deleteworkflow --workflow_uuid" and "podcast --disablefeed --feed_uuid" to ensure the Workflow has been deleted and all the associated RSS feeds are updated.

Logic: Now normally I would like to pull information from a database, however, the db.sqlite3 for workflows does not provide the name... only the ID, UUID, and Bundle Path (among other items).  Future release would be nice to get the correct BASH syntax and perform a PlistBuddy on the bundle_path field.  

2. Podcasts
Function: Even though this is listed for Podcasts, it only effects the PCP Library, not the actual Wiki/Blog page that your users see.  This is needed because if anyone actually dug into the PCP Library, they would be able to find all the test posts (or posts that were deleted for one reason or another).  The unfortunate thing is I cannot find any link between Wiki/Blog and the PCP Library within the OS or any SQLite3 databases.  

3. Wiki Posts
Function: The Wiki section of this script is needed because the minus button within the Wiki/Blog URL only deletes the page, not the media files (PNG/MOV).  There are a lot of sqlite3 commands against your Collaboration/globalIndex.db database, but in short it performs an UPDATE command that disables the post, then deletes all the files of that page.
