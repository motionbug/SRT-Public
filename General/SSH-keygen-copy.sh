### Description 
# The purpose of this script is to generate a SSH keypair, then copy to a remote server 
# so you can SSH into that server without having to type in a password.

username="$1"
server="$2"
id_rsa="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"
id_rsaPub="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

First checking to make sure that a username and FQDN has been passed as input variables.  
I'm not performing any sanity checkes, only verifing that they are not NULL

Next we need to have an id_rsa file to copy to our remote server.  If one is not available, create one.

Finally we will copy the id_rsa.pub fingerprint to our remote server.  A couple of things will (or could) happen:
	1) you WILL be prompted for your password for the username provided on your remote server.  This is OK
	2) if you get a SECOND password prompt.  Something is wrong.  Most likely on your remote server you need
		to create ~/.ssh/ folder because you have never 'SSH' out of your system."
