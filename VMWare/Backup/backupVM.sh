### Description 
# VMWare Fusion Backup
#===========
#
# The purpose of this script it to provide an automated system for backing up VMWare Fusion VMs that are 
# running on OS X. This is achiveved by: 
#	1) stop VMs 
#		1.5) create a snapshot, trim some old snapshots (if desired)
#	2) tgz to /tmp
#	3) scp to a remote server 
#	4) restart VMs
# The concept for this script would be in a production environment for weekly backups
#
# This script is best used after you have established SSH keys between your client and destination server.
# See the SSH-keygen-copy.sh script in our GIT repo
#
# Because we are using SSH to copy our VMs, the keytabs are stored in your user's Home folder.  Therefore, 
# we need to copy the com.stonyrivertech.vmware.backup.plist should be stored in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.  
# The plist is set to run on Saturdays at 11pm by default.
